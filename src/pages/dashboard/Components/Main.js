I need a WordPress website that visually looks amazing and works extremely well on mobile devices. I also need a premium theme that allows me to easily create additional pages as needed. Every blog I write in the coming weeks and months needs to be on its own page. I have no idea about the budget for this project. I just put a number down as a guess. Yes, I want a great deal, but more importantly, I want something that looks amazing and can be done in a few days (at most), not weeks. I want to hire very soon so I look forward to reading the proposals as they come in. When applying, please provide examples of previous WordPress websites you have created. Thank you for your interest.`,
